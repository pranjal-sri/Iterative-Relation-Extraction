Snafus with AI offerings have sent Google's stock tumbling before.
Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Redeem now Google is in a tough spot following public AI snafus.
The slip-up was so bad it sent the company's stock tumbling and had Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, address the troops, calling the situation "completely unacceptable.
"The debacle has strengthened the narrative that Google is suddenly behind in the AI race, and now there's a growing chorus of voices calling for the company to replace Pichai.
Advertisement Ben Thompson, an analyst and the author of the "Stratechery" newsletter, wrote this week that Google was in need of a transformation that would "mean removing those who let the former run amok, up to and including CEO Sundar Pichai."
Related stories Pichai, who was appointed CEO of Google in 2015 and Alphabet in 2019, has proven to be a strong peacetime CEO.
His tenure has been good for shareholders: Google's market cap is currently around $1.7 trillion, up from just over $400 billion in 2015 when Pichai took over.
Aravind Srinivas — a founder and CEO of Perplexity, a former OpenAI researcher, and a former Google and DeepMind intern — also weighed in on the debate about Pichai's future this week and even theorized who might replace the CEO.
Advertisement "Sundar is also the CEO of Alphabet, and he is best positioned to appoint the CEO of Google," whether that's someone new from outside the company, or an internal candidate, or "having himself continue," Srinivas wrote on X.Marissa has viewsEven Marissa Mayer, who was Google's 20th employee ever and worked there for 13 years, got involved in the debate.
Responding to a tweet by Othman Laraki, the CEO of Color Health, who said Google is facing an "unsolvable problem," Mayer somewhat defended Google."I
But the latest snafu has analysts worried about the long-term prospects, and whether Pichai can power Google through one of the biggest storms it's ever faced.

Your Email addressSign UpIn this article:The ScoopThe View From Sundar PichaiReed’s viewThe ScoopGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai addressed the company’s Gemini controversy Tuesday evening, calling the AI app’s problematic responses around race unacceptable and vowing to make structural changes to fix the problem.
The controversy spiraled when Gemini was found to be creating questionable text responses, such as equating Elon Musk’s influence on society with Adolf Hitler’s.
Reed’s viewThe Gemini controversy has provided fodder for critics on the right, who often accuse tech companies of liberal bias.
Based on my understanding of this saga, nobody at Google actually set out to force Gemini to depict the Pope as a woman, or Vikings as Black people, nor did anyone want it to find moral equivalency between Musk and Hitler.
The Gemini mistakes are a fixable, technical problem and Pichai’s note to staff Tuesday night shows that the company is working on it.

Investors is for Google As Sergey and I wrote in the original founders letter 11 years ago, “Google is not a conventional company.
I am really excited to be running Alphabet as CEO with help from my capable partner, Sergey, as President.
Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences (that works on the glucose-sensing contact lens), and Calico (focused on longevity).
Google itself is also making all sorts of new products, and I know Sundar will always be focused on innovation—continuing to stretch boundaries.
Our two classes of shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq as GOOGL and GOOG.For Sergey and me this is a very exciting new chapter in the life of Google—the birth of Alphabet.

2007)​Children2[1]RelativesCarrie Southworth (sister-in-law)Signature Lawrence Edward Page[2][3][4] (born March 26, 1973) is an American businessman, computer scientist and internet entrepreneur best known for co-founding Google with Sergey Brin.[2][5]
Page was chief executive officer of Google from 1997 until August 2001 when he stepped down in favor of Eric Schmidt and then again from April 2011 until July 2015 when he became CEO of its newly formed parent organisation Alphabet Inc. which was created to deliver "major advancements" as Google's parent company,[6] a post he held until December 4, 2019, when he along with his co-founder Brin stepped down from all executive positions and day-to-day roles within the company.
As of March 2024, Page has an estimated net worth of $125 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $122.8 billion, according to Forbes, making him the ninth-richest person in the world.[8][9]
His father, Carl Victor Page Sr., earned a PhD in computer science from the University of Michigan.
BBC reporter Will Smale described him as a "pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence".[25]
Page's father was a computer science professor at Michigan State University and his mother Gloria was an instructor in computer programming at Lyman Briggs College at the same institution.[28][25][29]
Larry's parents divorced when he was eight years old, but he maintained a good relationship both with his mother Gloria and his father's long-term partner and MSU professor Joyce Wildenthal.[30]: ch. 2 When Larry Page was six years old, in 1979, his father brought home an Exidy Sorcerer computer, which Larry soon mastered and began using for schoolwork.[31]
During an interview, Page recalled his childhood home "was usually a mess, with computers, science, and technology magazines and Popular Science magazines all over the place", an environment in which he immersed himself.[32]
His parents sent him to music summer camp—Interlochen Arts Camp in Interlochen, Michigan, and Page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing.
Education Page attended Okemos Montessori School (now called Montessori Radmoor) in Okemos, Michigan, from ages 2 to 7 (1975 to 1979).
Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD student, would soon join Page's research project, nicknamed "BackRub.
Together, the pair authored a research paper titled "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine", which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the Internet at the time.[28][44] John Battelle, co-founder of Wired magazine, wrote that Page had reasoned that: "[the] entire Web was loosely based on the premise of citation—after all, what is a link but a citation?
Battelle further described how Page and Brin began working together on the project: "At the time Page conceived of BackRub, the Web comprised an estimated 10 million documents, with an untold number of links between them.
